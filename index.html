    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Homemade Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250g) crushed graham crackers</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (70g) brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon (3g) fine sea salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (168g) unsalted, melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Key Lime Pie Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (4g) fresh key lime zest, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>14 ounces (400g) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) key lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Making the Pie Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl add 4 egg yolks and whisk in key lime zest that has been roughly chopped.</li>
        <li>Add sweetened condensed milk and whisk in key lime juice. Once thoroughly combined, cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature while preparing the crust.</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <h3>Pie Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place graham crackers into a plastic bag and crush using a rolling pin until it is mostly fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Place fine crumbs into a medium bowl along with brown sugar, fine sea salt, and whisk together before adding melted unsalted butter mixing together until a wet sand mixture is reached.</li>
        <li>Press into a 9" pie mold evenly, using the bottom of a flat cup. Bake the crust at 350 degrees F for 10 minutes. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once cooled, pour in the key lime pie filling and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-17 minutes or until set, but still slightly jiggly.</li>
        <li>Pull it out of the oven and let it cool most of the way, then place it in the fridge to let it cool completely, at least 3 hours but ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>After completely cooled, slice and serve with a dollop of whip cream and fresh grated key lime zest.</li>
    </ol>
